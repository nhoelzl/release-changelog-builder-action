## Setup

### Configure the workflow

Specify the action as part of your GitHub actions workflow:

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  id: build_changelog
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Action outputs

After action execution it will return the `changelog` and additional information as step output. You can use it in any follow-up step by referencing the output by referencing it via the id of the step. For example `build_changelog`.

```yml
# ${{steps.{CHANGELOG_STEP_ID}.outputs.changelog}}
${{steps.build_changelog.outputs.changelog}}
```

A full set list of possible output values for this action.

| **Output**          | **Description**                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `outputs.changelog` | The built release changelog built from the merged pull requests                                                           |
| `outputs.owner`     | Specifies the owner of the repository processed                                                                           |
| `outputs.repo`      | Describes the repository name, which was processed                                                                        |
| `outputs.fromTag`   | Defines the `fromTag` which describes the lower bound to process pull requests for                                        |
| `outputs.toTag`     | Defines the `toTag` which describes the upper bound to process pull request for                                           |

## Full Sample üñ•Ô∏è

Below is a complete example showcasing how to define a build, which is executed when tagging the project. It consists of:
- Prepare tag, via the GITHUB_REF environment variable
- Build changelog, given the tag
- Create release on GitHub - specifying body with constructed changelog
 
```yml
name: 'CI'
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

  release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Changelog
        id: github_release
        uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          body: ${{steps.github_release.outputs.changelog}}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Customization üñçÔ∏è

### Configuration

The action supports flexible configuration options to modify vast areas of its behavior. To do so, provide the configuration file to the workflow using the `configuration` setting.

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  with:
    configuration: "configuration.json"
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è When running this action for a non tags trigger the `toTag` can't be automatically resolved, as such it is either required to provide `toTag` directly, or to specify a different `fetch-depth:` with the checkout action to include tags.   

üí° By default not specifying `fromTag` or `toTag` will resolve `toTag` from either the `ref` or alternatively fallback to the latest tag from git. `fromTag` is resolved by sorting tags using [semver](https://semver.org/). Check the [configuration](#configuration-specification) for alternatives.

This configuration is a `.json` file in the following format.

```json
{
    "categories": [
      {
        "title": "## üöÄ Features",
        "labels": ["feature"]
      },
      {
        "title": "## üêõ Fixes",
        "labels": ["fix"]
      },
      {
        "title": "## üß™ Tests",
        "labels": ["test"]
      }
    ],
    "ignore_labels": [ 
      "ignore" 
    ],
    "sort": "ASC",
    "template": "${{CHANGELOG}}\n\n<details>\n<summary>Uncategorized</summary>\n\n${{UNCATEGORIZED}}\n</details>",
    "pr_template": "- ${{TITLE}}\n   - PR: #${{NUMBER}}",
    "empty_template": "- no changes",
    "transformers": [
      {
        "pattern": "[\\-\\*] (\\[(...|TEST|CI|SKIP)\\])( )?(.+?)\n(.+?[\\-\\*] )(.+)",
        "target": "- $4\n  - $6"
      }
    ],
    "max_tags_to_fetch": 200,
    "max_pull_requests": 200,
    "max_back_track_time_days": 365,
    "exclude_merge_branches": [
      "Owner/qa"
    ],
    "tag_resolver": {
      "method": "semver"
    }
}
```

Any section of the configuration can be omitted to have defaults apply.

üí° `ignore_labels` take precedence over category labels, allowing to specifically exclude certain PRs.

Defaults for the configuration can be found in the [configuration.ts](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/src/configuration.ts)

Please see the [Configuration Specification](#configuration-specification) for detailed descriptions on the offered configuration options. 

### Advanced workflow specification

For advanced use cases additional settings can be provided to the action

```yml
- name: "Complex Configuration"
  id: build_changelog

  with:
    configuration: "configuration_complex.json"
    owner: "mikepenz"
    repo: "release-changelog-builder-action"
    ignorePreReleases: "false"
    fromTag: "0.3.0"

| `token`             | Alternative config to specify token. You should prefer `env.GITHUB_TOKEN` instead though                                                                                 |
